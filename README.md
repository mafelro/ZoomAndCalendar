# ZoomAndCalendar
Stardew Valley mod for zooming in/out and calendar to character linking.

This is my first ever mod for any game. I added the following features:
- press PageUp to zoom in or PageDown to zoom out more than the game allows
- while viewing the calendar: press G on a birthday to see the character profile menu (easier to see liked gifts this way)

These features are just what I wanted the game to have built-in. A lot of mods have many more features but some of them feel OP so I decided to build my own with just these things. Maybe in the future I will add more features if I feel like they would be useful.
